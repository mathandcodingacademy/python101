# EX01 - Comparisons (COMMENTS ONLY)
#
# Goal:
#   Write a program that:
#     1) Asks the user for TWO numbers
#     2) Prints answers to these questions:
#         - Are they equal?
#         - Is the first bigger?
#         - Is the first smaller?
#
# Rules:
#   - Use input() twice
#   - Convert both inputs to int
#   - Use print() for each answer
#
# Hint:
#   n1 = int(input("Number 1: "))
#   n2 = int(input("Number 2: "))
#   print("Are they equal? ->", n1 == n2)
