# Python 101 – Week 1 Instructions

Welcome to Python! 🐍  
This week is about learning how programs *think*, not about being perfect.

## How to Work
- Open one `.py` file at a time.
- Read the code from **top to bottom**.
- Run the file and look carefully at the output.
- If something breaks, **read the error**. Errors are clues, not failures.

## For Lesson Files
- These files already have working code.
- Your job is to:
  - Run them
  - Change small things (text, numbers, names)
  - Predict what will happen before you run them again

## For Exercise Files (Comments Only)
- These files start with `EX`.
- They contain **instructions only**, no code.
- Your job is to:
  - Write Python code under the comments
  - Follow the rules in the comments
  - Make the program run without errors

## Important Rules
- Python runs code **top to bottom**.
- Quotes `" "` mean text.
- Numbers without quotes are math.
- Variable names must match **exactly**.
- Errors are normal. Even professional programmers get them daily.

## Mindset
You are not “bad at coding” if it doesn’t work the first time.  
You are *learning how to talk to a computer* — and computers are very literal.

Have fun. Be curious. Break things (on purpose). 🙂
